# MakeAndEatIt
This is a MERN project that allows the user to create virtual orders of different kinds of sandwiches, the idea and what made it different was working on more interactive front end applications, and more user appealing interfaces. I got to experience with popular new technologies such as Vite, and keep gaining experience with popular web development frameworks such as MERN.
